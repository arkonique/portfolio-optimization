# Portfolio Optimizer

This tool fetches key data for selected stock tickers and applies Monte Carlo simulations to construct efficient portfolios. It identifies the tangency portfolio—the allocation with the highest Sharpe ratio—and provides an intuitive interface to test different investment sizes. Simply input the amount you’d like to invest, and the tool calculates how much to allocate to each stock for optimal risk-adjusted returns.
